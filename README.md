# My new SDL try (second)
The last tray was pretty lousy. 
I pushed a lot there, because I did not understand what and how it works. 
Now I have already figured out a little about SDL, and I decided, since everything is not very good with OOP, I need to try to release my ideas in a language that I understand, the C language.

# What I want to do as a result:
- It should be a lightweight, DOS-like text editor, with support for syntax.

# What tasks do I set for myself in this project:
- Must be written in pure C.
- Must support the syntax of all programming languages known to mankind at the moment
- Should be as portable as possible
- Perhaps as customizable as possible like Vim.

## At the moment, there are three possible functions available:
- Write/delete text, save/open a recorded file.

## In the near future, I want to add: 
- Changing the name and extension of the file that is being recorded.
